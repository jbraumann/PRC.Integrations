Copy the extension to the relevant directory, such as %APPDATA%\Adobe\CEP\extensions
You may have to create the CEP/extensions folders.
Make sure you can run unsigned plugins:https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/CEP-Resources/blob/master/CEP_12.x/Documentation/CEP%2012%20HTML%20Extension%20Cookbook.md#debugging-unsigned-extensions
Optionally: Open the directory in VS Code, install the ExtendScript Debugger.
