# Parametric Robot Control

Parametric Robot Control uses [GRPC](https://grpc.io/) to establish a communication between the client software (e.g. Grasshopper) and the server, where the robot is simulated, real-time control is established etc.
The communication is based on *.proto files, which can be translated into various programming languages. Please refer to our (beta) [documentation](https://parametricrobotcontrol.notion.site/) for more details.


# Caution!

#### Our expertise lies in robot simulation, not necessarily in writing beautiful code. Please consider the code snippets to be proof-of-concept rather than best-practise - especially Python and Javascript code can be quite "hacky"!
We welcome suggestions on how to improve the code, as well as entirely new integrations.
